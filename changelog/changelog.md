# Changelog — UNH fork of jlab_pynmr

A record of what changed in this repository and why. Commit messages say *what*
changed line by line; each entry here gives the overview and the reasoning behind it.

Conventions:
- Newest entries first, one heading per date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Each entry: a short title, **What** changed (files or areas touched), and **Why**.
- Note changes that are local to a clone (git config, hooks) and not tracked in the
  repo, so anyone setting up a fresh clone knows to repeat them.
- History before 2026-10-05 is James Maxwell's upstream work (jdmax/jlab_pynmr). It
  is recorded only in the git log.

### Interactive NMR frequency window on the Run tab (branch `unh_dev/interactive_freq_window`)

**What**
- `gui/tabs/run_tab.py`: the NMR Settings box has new **Center Freq (MHz)** and
  **Half-width ± (kHz)** inputs and an **Apply Window** button.
  - The inputs stay editable during a run.
  - The label under the channel selector shows the active window and any pending change.
  - Selecting a channel resets the fields to that channel's values from the config file.
- `gui/main_window.py`: new `set_window()`, `apply_pending_window()`, `replace_config()` and
  `run_in_progress()`.
  - **When idle,** a change applies immediately and reprograms the R&S.
  - **During a run,** it is held and applied by `RunTab.start_thread` just before the next event starts.
    The event in progress keeps its window. The FPGA gets the new frequency table automatically,
    because each event's DAQ connection sends it.
  - **Every change builds a new `Config` from a copy of the channel settings.** Events keep a
    reference to their own Config, so editing the shared one would rewrite the frequency axis
    of events already taken.
  - **Run settings carry over:** Sweeps, CC and the phase/diode tune values carry over on window
    *and channel* changes. Before, a channel change silently reset Sweeps to 640 and CC to −0.08,
    while the Run tab still showed the old values.
  - **Logging:** every change goes to the log and the status bar.
  - **Session file:** the window is saved in `config/<session>.yaml` (`cent_freq`, `mod_freq`) and
    restored at startup when the saved channel matches.
- `pynmr_config.yaml` can take an optional `settings.window_limits` with `cent_min`,
  `cent_max`, `hw_min_khz` and `hw_max_khz`. These are the input bounds. Code defaults
  (1–500 MHz, 1–2000 kHz) apply if it's absent; set it to match the R&S FM deviation limits.
- `hardware/daq.py` (**Test mode only**): the simulated DAQ now returns the recorded test signal
  *at the frequencies the window asks for*.
  - The recording is `utils/d_signal_event.txt`: deuteron, 31.43–32.23 MHz.
  - It is interpolated onto the current window's frequency points.
  - Points outside the recorded range hold the nearest recorded edge value, with the usual
    test noise added. The off-recording part therefore looks like flat baseline instead of a jump
    to zero, which kept the plots readable when the window is moved past the recording.
  - Before, the same 512 recorded points were replayed on whatever axis the channel set, so a
    deuteron line appeared at 212.9 MHz on the Proton5T channel.
  - A window equal to the recording's own (31.83 MHz ± 400 kHz) gives back the original signal exactly.
- `tests/test_freq_window.py`: new tests covering:
  - the frequency axis and the FPGA table;
  - idle versus between-event application;
  - no in-place changes to an existing config, and carry-over of settings;
  - Test-mode interpolation and edge-hold outside the recording.

  It is kept outside `utils/` because `utils/__init__.py` breaks pytest collection.

**Why**
During a cooldown UNH needs to move the NMR window without restarting:
- the field is rarely exactly 5 T, so the Larmor frequency shifts;
- ND3, d-butanol and d-propanediol have different quadrupole widths.

The width is entered as a **half-width (±kHz)**, with the same meaning as `mod_freq`, so the
config file and the Run tab agree. The old UNH LabVIEW panel's "Freq Span" is a **full** width,
so the factor of 2 matters when comparing the two. Each event still writes its own `freq_list`
and window to the event file, so data from a cooldown with window changes can be analysed
event by event afterwards.

**Known gaps (separate decisions, not in this change)**
- **Calibration:** area is a plain sum over bins, so it depends on bin width. A CC measured with
  one width doesn't transfer to another.
- **Baselines:** they aren't checked for a matching window.
- **Wings and integration ranges:** they are sweep fractions, so they move with the window.
- **History points:** they don't record the window.
- **Fit start values:** the Deuteron fit's `wL` start value doesn't follow the center.

### LabVIEW panel reference notes

**What**
- New `notes/labview_panel_differences.md`: features of the old UNH LabVIEW NMR panel that
  PyNMR lacks or does differently, for later work.
- `.gitignore`: added `.claude/reference/`. The LabVIEW screenshot the notes are based on is
  kept locally at `.claude/reference/labview_nmr_panel.png` and is not shared through git.

**Why**
To keep a record of the quality-of-life features UNH wants to bring over, so they can be
taken up one at a time.

### Push guard allows per-topic development branches (`unh_dev/<topic>`)

**What**
- `.git/hooks/pre-push` now allows pushing `unh` and `unh_dev/<topic>` to
  `unhpoltarg/jlab_pynmr`. The hook is local to a clone and not tracked in the repo.
  Everything else is still blocked: `master`, `testing`, tags, other branch names, and any
  push to `jdmax/jlab_pynmr`.

**Why**
To give experimental work a place where it can break things without touching `unh`.
`unh` stays the stable, runnable branch. Development uses one branch per topic, named
`unh_dev/<topic>` (for example `unh_dev/te-fix`) and branched from `unh`. Each topic branch
is pushed to GitHub as a backup and is merged back into `unh` (`git merge --no-ff`) once
it works. A plain `unh_dev` branch is not used, because git cannot hold `unh_dev` and
`unh_dev/<topic>` at the same time.

### `unh` is now the default branch of the fork

**What**
- On GitHub, set the default branch of `unhpoltarg/jlab_pynmr` to `unh` (was `master`).
  `jdmax/jlab_pynmr` is unchanged and still defaults to `master`.
- In the local clone, updated `origin/HEAD` to point at `origin/unh`
  (`git remote set-head origin -a`).

**Why**
`unh` is where all UNH work happens. With it as the default, new clones check it out,
the repo page shows it, and new in-fork pull requests target it. Nobody has to remember
to switch away from `master`.

### Repository moved to the unhpoltarg organization; pushes restricted to `unh`

**What**
- Transferred the fork from `ellie-long/jlab_pynmr` to `unhpoltarg/jlab_pynmr` on
  GitHub. The fork relationship to `jdmax/jlab_pynmr` is kept.
- Local clone setup (not tracked in the repo; repeat it in any new clone):
  - `origin` → `https://github.com/unhpoltarg/jlab_pynmr.git`
  - `upstream` (`jdmax/jlab_pynmr`) is fetch-only: its push URL is set to `DISABLED`.
  - `remote.pushDefault=origin` and `push.default=upstream`
  - `.git/hooks/pre-push` rejects any push other than `refs/heads/unh` to
    `unhpoltarg/jlab_pynmr`. That includes tags and pushes to other branches.
- `.claude/settings.local.json`: added `deny` rules so Claude Code cannot skip git
  hooks (`--no-verify`), force-push, or push to `upstream`.

**Why**
UNH polarized-target development should be kept separate from upstream.
- All UNH work lives on the `unh` branch under the group's GitHub organization, not
  a personal account.
- Nothing should be pushed by accident to `master` or to James Maxwell's original
  repository.
- Commits are still authored as `Elena Long <ellie@jlab.org>`, which GitHub credits
  to the `ellie-long` account.

### Local Claude Code notes file (gitignored)

**What**
- `.gitignore`: added `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in the local clone. It is not tracked. It holds the repo rules
  (push only to `unh`, keep this changelog current), the fresh-clone git setup including
  the pre-push hook script, and a short codebase orientation.

**Why**
It gives Claude Code a durable place in the repo for its working context and rules.
Ignoring it keeps machine-specific notes out of the shared history.

### Changelog added

**What**
- New `changelog/changelog.md` (this file).

**Why**
To keep a readable, human-level history of changes and the reasons for them,
alongside commit messages.
